<h1> You </h1>
<p>
I prepared for you, a menagerie of tigers <br>
ice skating on my eyeballs.<br>
I made you a cake with arsenic<br>
so you can give it to your<br>
favourite enemies and still feel like a kind person.<br>
I painted your face on top of my face so<br>
we can be matching and so if you want<br>
to take the day off work or perhaps<br>
avoid going to the dentist, I could go.<br>
I shaved my pubes, just in case<br>
that was something you thought I should do.<br>
I ran you a bath of graces,<br>
it’s basically just women I found online called grace,<br>
in a bath, they’re waiting in there ready for you.<br>
I opened the oven just in time<br>
for the smell of fresh bread<br>
to float down the street and<br>
plant tiny hooks in your nostrils,<br>
to reel you into my home.<br>
I watch from behind my window<br>
as you walk past, as you carry on.<br>
Your head scooped back to pick up more sun.<br>
