<h1> Bald </h1>
<p>
I am a married man. I am<br>
a pot, a pan, a kitchen appliance.<br>
I have stretched underwear.<br>
I have failing, flailing hair.<br>
I have a tan line under my ring.<br>
I keep secret nothings from my wife, I keep<br>
them in the spice cupboard, written on<br>
the dead bugs. The summer will be here<br>
soon, and so will the woman<br>
in towels and jandals. The beach will<br>
be a room for us to sit in, again. We will<br>
have to get a faulty car, a troubled child, a<br>
perilous debt to a dangerous man.<br>
My wife, my life, she’s a bit fatter<br>
than she used to be. She has secrets too,<br>
I can hear them buzzing when she’s doing<br>
nothing in our clean, quiet bed. I can hear<br>
them above her head,<br>
above her long, empty dreams.<br>
